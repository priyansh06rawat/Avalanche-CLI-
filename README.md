## Creating a DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche
Let's transport ourselves into a thrilling world of blockchain-based gaming üïπÔ∏è and explore the creation of a DeFi Kingdom üè∞ clone on Avalanche. In this digital realm, players can collect, build, and battle with their digital assets, earning rewards through various game activities.
DeFi Kingdoms is a highly complex decentralized finance application that cannot be fully comprehended in just a few hours. Therefore, in this discussion, we will only be covering the fundamentals related to custom subnet development.
### Steps
**1. Set up your EVM subnet**: You can use our guide and the Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.

**2. Define your native currency**: You can set up your own native currency, which can be used as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.

**3. Connect to Metamask**: Connect you EVM Subnet to metamask, this can be done by following the steps laid out in our guide.

**4. Deploy basic building blocks**: You can use Solidity and Remix to deploy the basic building blocks of your game, such as smart contracts for battling, exploring, and trading. These contracts will define the game rules, such as liquidity pools, tokens, and more.
